# NanoMax Python Tools for Users
A toolbox for analysis of the data from NanoMax beamline, MAX IV (Sweden)

Download latest Version from Github:

git clone https://github.com/DzhigaevD/nanomax_tools.git

OR

Update to latest version: Fetch latest version of the 'main' branch from the remote repository 'origin' and reset/overwrite all local changes. New files that were created locally and which do not exist in the latest branch are not deleted.

git fetch origin main & git reset --hard origin/main

Before updating you can back-up local files by branching if necessary:

git add --all git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE" git branch NAME_OF_BRANCH

To check which files were modified and which new (untracked files):

git status
